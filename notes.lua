The scene manager dispatches the following four events:
enterBegin: Dispatched when your new scene is about to enter the stage. You can initialize your variables here.
enterEnd: Dispatched after the transition of new scene has ended. Mostly, you add listeners and start your logic here.
exitBegin: Dispatched when your current scene is about to leave the stage. You can remove listeners and stop timers here.
exitEnd: Dispatched after your current scene has leaved the stage.
